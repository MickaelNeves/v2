            Back in 2016, I took a leap of faith and{" "}
            <AnimatedPhrase phrase="switched careers" /> from being a telecom
            technician to diving deep into the world of web development. The
            initial spark? My passion for coding was ignited by dreams of game
            development. While the game development scene in Portugal
            didn&apos;t offer many opportunities, my previous portfolio took on
            a fun twist â€” it was designed as a{" "}
            <AnimatedWord word="game!" type="vortex" /> and led me to the vast
            and ever-evolving landscape of web development, and I haven&apos;t
            looked back since.
